# Source File Format: project.inf

A project is any directory that contains a project.inf file at its root. This manifest file 
defines the project‚Äôs identity and metadata‚Äîwhat it requires, what it provides, how it 
should be built, and where deployment tools must connect‚Äîso that source and deployment 
systems can discover and manage it automatically.

Projects may live at any depth under your source tree but must never be nested inside one 
another: each project.inf marks the top of a standalone project - standalone directory 
hierarchy. The file itself follows a Java-properties‚Äìstyle syntax, including backslashes at
line ends to continue long or multi-valued properties across several indented lines. It 
supports standard escapes (\t, \n, \:, \=, \\) and Unicode (\uXXXX), giving you a flexible 
yet predictable format for all your project metadata.

Variety of notations supported, like the form ```Property: value[ value2 ...]\n``` or 
slightly different ```Property = value[ value2 ...]\n```, as well, as:

```
	Property: \
		value1 \
		value2 \
	
	...
```

In project's project.inf file we focus on following properties:

	- 'Name' - the name of the project, It should match the folder name and may include the
		full project ID (the path in the source tree).

	- 'Requires' - list of other projects or their 'Provides' items that this project depends 
		on.

	- 'Declares' - project properties that given project declares and that are applied to
		given project only.

	- 'Provides' - project properties that all other projects requiring given project will 
		inherit.

	- 'Keywords' - the search kewords for given project to be found and selected on source
		and deploy operations.


Declares are metadata entries that apply only to the project in which they‚Äôre defined‚Äîthey 
describe or configure that project alone and are never passed on to dependents. Provides 
metadata entries, by contrast, are properties exported to every project that lists this one 
in its Requires. For example, an abstract-db-node module might declare (Declares) its own 
Git repository URL or internal package name (information only it needs), while providing 
(in Provides) shared initialization parameters, like: connection strings, default schemas, 
feature flags‚Äîthat all requiring projects automatically inherit.


# More details on project.inf format:

##   üìú Java .properties Format Essentials

	Input format is java properties file format, that is flexible and user-friendly. So we 
	describe the basic details here.

###    ‚úÖ Key-Value Syntax

	- key=value and key:value are both valid.

	- Whitespace around the separator (= or :) is ignored.

	- Leading whitespace before the key is ignored.

	- Trailing whitespace after the value is preserved.

###    üí¨ Comments

	- Lines starting with # or ! are treated as comments and ignored.

	- Blank lines are ignored.

###    üîÑ Line Continuation

	- A backslash (\) at the end of a line continues the value onto the next line.

	- Leading whitespace on continued lines is ignored.

###    üî† Escaping Special Characters

	- \: ‚Üí literal colon

	- \= ‚Üí literal equals

	- \\ ‚Üí literal backslash

	- \t, \n, \r ‚Üí tab, newline, carriage return

	- \uXXXX ‚Üí Unicode character (e.g. \u002c for comma)

###    üîÅ Duplicate Keys

	- If a key appears multiple times, the last occurrence wins.

###    üåç Encoding

	- Files are expected to be in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) or UTF-8.
	- Non-Latin (Latin-1) or Non-Printable (Unicode) characters must be escaped using \uXXXX.

##  üìú Internal project.inf format

	In order for source tools to work efficiently with project meta-data, source system creates
	the index and internal copies of project.inf files in a stripped simplified format by 
	building local cache hierarchy. The converter utility runs on bash 3.2 or emulated sh of 
	MacOSX, FreeBSD or Linux.

###    Source project.inf parser/stripper/reformatter steps

	- Assume file is in UTF-8 encoding or all non-latin values are properly escaped;

	- Strip comments and ignore blank lines;

	- Collapse line continuations into a single logical value, collapse whitespace around continuation (if any) into single space;

	- Skip properties other than: `Name`, `Requires`, `Keywords`, `Declares`, `Provides`;

	- Normalize the first occurrence of either `:` or `=` as the key-value separator, keeping any additional separators in the value;

	- Duplicate keys produce stderr warning and concatenated with single space between existing and new value;

	- Unescape all supported sequences: `\\`, `\=`, `\:`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and Unicode escapes like `\uXXXX`;

	- Output lines in strict <property>=<value> format, with values unquoted and unescaped.

###    parser/stripper/reformatter, input example

	So, an input file like: 

  ```properties
	# This is a sample project configuration
	Name: test-project

	Description: My First Test Project
	
	Requires: \
		base-system \
		core-logging \
		common-ui \

	Keywords: \
		test1 \
		test1 \

	Declares: \
		build-source-tools:actions \
		user-ext-myx:admin \

  ```

###    parser/stripper/reformatter, output example

	The stripped version, generated will look like:

	```Name=test-project```
	```Requires=base-system core-logging common-ui```
	```Keywords=test1 test1```
	```Declares=build-source-tools:actions user-ext-myx:admin```
